# OverwatchLeagueWrapper


Todo. 
1. Make write csv a function
2. Change the wrapper to grab all players in a team/list


Takes OWL team name or abbreviation and spews out players on the roster.
Hopefully will spew out stats in the future.

Thanks to Jepp and Splopp for helping me get th rough so much of this.
